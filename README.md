# Cookie-Approval for PHP /JS
Full-Page cookie approval banner/popup

This is a simple full-page cookie banner for your website or app. Based on HTML/PHP and JS.
Upload the JS file to your asset directory and define the name of your cookie.

Add the CSS Style to your website in your current file or add this one as additional. Here we have some optional mobile settings, which are already used in the banner. You can remove it if you text is not too large. We recommend using it.
Finally, ad the content of the PHP file to your website header, change the path to your files and add the legal text.
